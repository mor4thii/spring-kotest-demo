# About the repository

On the `main` branch, a clean Spring Boot 2.7.1 project as generated from Spring initializr was committed.
It shows that Spring Boot 2.7.1-based projects basically build.

On the `kotest` branch, the kotest dependency is added to check whether it works w/ Spring Boot 2.7.1
On the `kotest-with-spring-2-7-0` branch, we check whether kotest 5.4.x works w/ Spring Boot 2.7.0

# How to compile and run tests
